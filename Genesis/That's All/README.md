# Genesis - That's All

This folder holds my attempts to capture the bass notes for Genesis - That's All, as played by Mitch (bassplay12) here:

I claim no ownership of the music or the arrangement, this file was created for educational purposes only.

* That's All.pdf contains the notes, plus lyrics, plus tabs
* Tabs plus voice.pdf contains the tabs plus the voice
* Tab only.pdf is a much shorter 1 page version, showing just the tabs.

These files were made using Frescobaldi - an IDE for Lilypond.
